## Description
This extension detects and counts failed login attempts for a user and logs each failed attempt in the user log.  
At the next successful login the user will be notified of the number of failed login attempts with a message box which includes a button to remove it. The counted failed attempts
will the be deleted from the user's data; this will also happen at the next successful login if the remove button has not been activated.
  
*Note to the administrator:* This extension does not have any settings in the ACP!
